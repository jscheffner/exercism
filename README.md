# Exercism Solutions

I'm a passionate JavaScript/Node.js developer but I'm also interested in programming languages in general. I try to learn new programming languages from time to time and exercism is a great tool for doing so. You can view my solutions in this repository but you can also just visit my [public exercism profile](https://exercism.io/profiles/jscheffner).

Also, I encourage anybody to become a mentor for a programming language they are proficient in. You can find more information about the mentoring program [here](https://exercism.io/become-a-mentor).
